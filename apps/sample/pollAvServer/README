>> How to package a Legato application that will be installed from AirVantage 
1. Build a legato application

2. Put your app (.ar7 or .wp7) inside a tar archive (This is required by the AirVantage platform)
    e.g.
    $ tar cvpf helloWorld.ar7.tar helloWorld.ar7
    
3. Create an appmodel.file as such (modify appropriately to suit your app):

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ASCII"?>
    <app:application xmlns:app="http://www.sierrawireless.com/airvantage/application/1.0" name="HelloWorldTest" revision="1.0" type="HelloWorldTest">
      <application-manager use="MIHINI_APPCON"/>
      <binaries>
        <binary file="HelloWorldTest.wp7.tar"/>
      </binaries>
    </app:application>
    
4. Create a zip archive containing appmodel.app and your app (e.g. helloWorld.ar7.tar)
    e.g.
    $ zip myapp.zip appmodel.app helloWorld.ar7.tar

5. Upload this to AirVantage and assuming you have already registered your device. You can install it.
