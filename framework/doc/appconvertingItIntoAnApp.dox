Now take the source code file (hello.c) and make an application out of it.

Applications are described by an "application definition" text file ending
with the suffix ".adef".  The format is intended to be easy to read
and write.

To turn hello.c into an application, create an application definition
file called "helloWorld.adef" that looks like this:

@verbatim
executables:

    helloWorld ( hello.c )


processes:

    run: (helloWorld)
@endverbatim

This defines one executable called helloWorld implemented by hello.c, 
and then starts one instance of the helloWorld executable.

@note If your executable has multiple source files, add more files inside the
      parentheses after the executable name: "helloWorld ( hello.c foo.c )".

Run @c mkapp to build the executable and bundle it into an application.


Use the "-t" option to build a target other than the default "localhost"
target, (e.g., to build the helloWorld application for a device running the
Sierra Wireless AR7 module):

@verbatim
$ mkapp -t ar7 helloWorld.adef
@endverbatim

Now, you have a file called helloWorld.ar7.  Use "instapp" to install it on your target 
so it can be started automatically by the Supervisor when the device boots up.

@verbatim
$ instapp helloWorld.ar7 <ip addr>
@endverbatim

The second argument tells the target device host address from where to run the application.
This will connect to the target, upload the application, and start it.

@note  Your installed application output will display in /var/log/messages in the target device,
 not on the terminal you used to install the application.

Use "rmapp" to uninstall your application.

@verbatim
$ rmapp helloWorld.ar7 <ip addr>
@endverbatim

Use "lsapp" to list the applications installed on a target.

@verbatim
$ lsapp <ip addr>
@endverbatim
