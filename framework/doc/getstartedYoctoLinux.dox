/** @page getstartedYoctoLinux Yocto Linux

The Yocto Project is an open source collaboration project that provides templates, 
tools and methods to help you create custom Linux-based systems for embedded 
products regardless of the hardware architecture.

Legato is compatible with Yocto 1.6.

@section yoctoDirectories Yocto Linux Directories

Untar the file @b Legato-Dist-Source-mdm9x15-14.04.tar.bz2 to a directory: 
@code 
$ cd <some directory> 
$ tar xvjf Legato-Linux-Dist-mdm9x15-14.04.tar.bz2
@endcode

These file/directories will be extracted: 
- <b>linux-yocto-3.4.git</b>  -  Linux kernel - 14.1.0.Beta.rc2
- <b>Legato-Yocto1_4</b> -  Sierra Wireless specific layers
- <b>meta-swi</b> -  Hardware adaptations
- <b>meta-swi-extras</b> -  Build scripts and proprietary code

Yocto uses a layered model for its build system. In Legato, device-specific layers are
 @c meta-swi-[target] and @c meta-swi-bin.

@section prebuiltYoctoImages Pre-built Yocto Image

The prebuilt directory contains a kernel and root file system that can be built using the 
command below. It's the same as what's flashed on the device, and can be used to 
return to a known state. 

- @b kernel - kernel image 
- @b rootfs - smallish root file system ready for basic development. 

Instructions on how to flash these images to the device are given in the file README.bsp. 

@section rebuildYoctoImages Rebuild Yocto Image

Instructions for rebuilding the image are contained in the file 
Legato-Yocto1_4/meta-swi-extras/README.build 

Running the build script with no arguments will print out the help message. There is also a file 
called @c stdbuild.sh to build the images with common options. This can take a long time the first time you run it. 
Once the build is complete, you'll find new images in the directory: 
@code
../build/tmp/deploy/images @endcode

Links are created at the end of the build to point to the latest kernel (kernel) and root file system (rootfs)
@warning You canâ€™t rebuild Yocto images on Ubuntu 13.10.

@section flashYoctoImagesWin Windows Flash Yocto 
The easiest way to flash a Yocto image is through Windows. The steps are the same as upgrading  
to the latest firmware that includes flashing the Yocto image:</p>

- Download @c SWI9X15W_06.03.17.00-wp_yocto-cwe.exe to your host. <br> 
 See <a href="http://developer.sierrawireless.com/Resources/Resources/Legato/Distribution.aspx">Legato Downloads</a>

- Turn the board BOOT switch to 'OFF' (Recovery mode). Depending on your dev kit, 'LOW' is 
the same as 'OFF'. 

- Connect the target: displays in Device Manager list as 'Sierra DM Port' under Ports.

- Run @c SWI9X15W_06.03.17.00-wp_yocto-cwe.exe by double-clicking the file.
After the image flash process completes, it will advise it's resetting the target.

- Disconnect power from your target and turn your BOOT switch to 'ON' (or 'HIGH'). 

- Reconnect power to your target; it should enumerate (with other targets) under 
Ports in Window Device Manager. 

Connect to the target's AT Port (through HyperTerminal or Tera Term), and run @c ati to verify 
the flash update was successful. Output will look like this:

@verbatim
Manufacturer: Sierra Wireless, Incorporated
Model: WP7102
Revision: SWI9X15W_06.03.17.00 r23799 CNSHZ-AR-BUILD 2014/08/08 13:02:24
IMEI: (Your imei)
IMEI SV: 0
+GCAP: +CGSM,+FCLASS,+DS
@endverbatim

@note Flashing a new image will override existing settings. To easily keep your ecm on Linux, just temporarily rename your 
usbmode file; or you can always create a new one.  @ref yoctoCDC and @ref getstartedConfigIPusb

@section flashYoctoImagesLin Linux Flash Yocto  

You can flash the Yocto images on Linux;, the device must be in @e fastboot mode. 
From the shell prompt on the device run:
@code
root@swi-mdm9x15:~# sys_reboot bootloader @endcode

After a few seconds, the device will enumerate as an Android Bootloader Device. You can 
test this on the development PC with:

@code dave@devpc$ fastboot devices
MDM9615
@endcode

Then erase and rewrite the kernel and root filesystem partitions using the fastboot command 
(the partitions are called kernel and rootfs):

@code
dave@devpc $ fastboot erase kernel
...
dave@devpc $ fastboot erase rootfs
...
dave@devpc $ fastboot flash kernel kernel
...
dave@devpc $ fastboot flash rootfs rootfs
...
dave@devpc $ fastboot reboot
rebooting...
finished. total time: 0.001s
@endcode

@note You have to use the micro-USB connection for fastboot
 
@section custYoctoImages Custom Yocto Image

Because the Legato image is a Yocto-compliant BSP, there are many options for customizing. 

Here's the easy way to add some packages to the rootfs: 

@code meta-swi-extras/meta-swi-bin/recipes/images/9615-cdp-sierra-image.inc @endcode

For more complex customizations, refer to the Yocto documentation.
