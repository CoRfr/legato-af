@section instDevStud Install Developer Studio

See Developer Studio installation: http://developer.sierrawireless.com/developerstudio

@note Youâ€™ll need to install the IDE for Legato Application Framework feature to 
develop Legato applications and connect to Legato devices.

@section configDevStud Configure Developer Studio

Before you can develop Legato applications, there's some config
steps to complete.

<b>Configure Developer Studio toolchain path</b> 

Legato Linux GCC path has to be configured in Developer Studio so it can build Legato applications. 
Dev Studio needs to find the @c arm-poky-linux-gnueabi-gcc compiler.
It's done in the Window > Preferences dialog, at Developer Studio > Tools preferences > GCC/GDB 
paths preferences location. 

Here's the path:

@verbatim
/opt/swi/y14-ext/tmp/sysroots/x86_64-linux/usr/bin/armv7a-vfp-neon-poky-linux-gnueabi
@endverbatim

See @ref getstartedInstallPackages for toolchain installation info.

<b>Configure Legato package</b>

Developer Studio needs the location of the Legato Framework package build directory so it can use it.
In the Package Manager perspective, click on the Add Repository button of the Available Packages view. 

You'll need to point on the Legato Package directory.

@note Build the Legato Framework before installing Developer Studio.

As soon as the path is set, Developer Studio will detect the Legato package. Then, you can select it, 
and click the Install action in order to configure the package.

@section usingDevStud Use Developer Studio

You can use Developer Studio features like these with Legato applications and devices:

- In the Applications perspective, create, develop and build applications.
- In the Remote System Explorer perspective, connect and interact with Legato devices.
- In the Debug perspective, perform step-by-step debugging sessions in a running Legato application.
