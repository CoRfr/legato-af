<h1>Install the Legato Application Framework</h1>

As you read through the concepts we recommend downloading and installing the Legato Application
Framework on a Linux machine, so you can see examples of how we have applied the same concepts in
developing the Application Framework.  To install the Legato Application Framework follow the
@ref basicBuild guide.
