@section cmDataUsage CM Data

@verbatim cm data @endverbatim
> Get info on profile in use

@verbatim cm data profile <index> @endverbatim
> Set profile in use

@verbatim cm data apn <apn> @endverbatim
> Set apn for profile in use

@verbatim cm data pdp <pdp> @endverbatim

@verbatim cm data connect <optional timeout (secs)> @endverbatim
> Start a data connection

@verbatim cm data list @endverbatim
> List all the profiles

@verbatim cm data watch @endverbatim
> Monitor the data connection

To start a data connection, please ensure that your profile has been configured correctly.
Also ensure your modem is registered to the network. To verify, use <c>cm radio</c> and check @c Status.

If you specify a time-out timer when starting a data connection, it will try to start a data 
connection until the timer expires.

When starting a data connection, currently it only uses profile 1. Any configuration set for other 
profiles can't be used to start a data connection through the cm tool.

@subsection Legato Beta 14.04 Users

If you're upgrading from Legato Beta 14.04, data connection operation will be slightly different. 
Once you have a data connection started successfully, the process will continue running. 

To stop the session, do one of these:
- Run <c>cm data connect</c> as usual and if you want to release the data connection, simply press CTRL+C.
- Run <c>cm data connect &</c>  (background) and if you want to release the data connection, kill the process (<c>kill \<pid\></c>).
