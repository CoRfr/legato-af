/** @page getstartedDevKitCables  Dev Kit Cables


The following cables are used for communication between a dev host and the dev kit/target:

@b UART2

This is a serial port to USB cable to the dev host. It provides serial console communication to embedded Linux. 
It requires Minicom (or similar tool) to access device. 

These are the UART2 port settings: <br>
- Speed -115200 baud 
- Parity - None 
- Bits - 8 
- Stop bits - 1 
- Flow control - None 

If youâ€™re running Minicom, set these config options through the CTRL+A O (configure) serial port setup. 

@b Ethernet

The Ethernet cable lets you plug into a locat network for a direct connection. 
It obtains a dynamic IP address for the target using DHCP. This matches subnet values between the 
target and the host so ssh commands will be available.  

@b Micro-USB

This is a Micro-USB port to USB cable to the dev host. It provides access to IP 
over USB after it's been configured for @c ecm. 

The micro-USB provides access to fastboot, CDC-ECM, CDC-ACM (AT 
commands), USB Audio, and Ethernet over USB (through an adapter).
