To start a data connection, ensure that your profile is configured correctly.
Also ensure your modem is registered to the network. To verify, use <c>cm radio</c> and check @c Status.

If you specify a time-out timer when starting a data connection, it will try to start a data
connection until the timer expires.

When starting a data connection, currently it only uses profile 1. Any configuration set for other
profiles can't be used to start a data connection through the cm tool.

@subsection toolsTarget_cmDataUsage_14_04 14.04 Users

If you're upgrading from Legato Beta 14.04, data connection operation will be slightly different.
Once you have a data connection started successfully, the process will continue running.

To stop the session, do one of these:
- Run <c>cm data connect</c> as usual and if you want to release the data connection, simply press CTRL+C.
- Run <c>cm data connect &</c>  (background) and if you want to release the data connection, kill the process (<c>kill \<pid\></c>).
