/** @page getstartedTargetSetup Setup Target Software

Here's how to set up and run your target from a Linux command-line. There are also @ref getstartedTargetAdvanced.

@section getstartedTargetSetup_serialCmn Host/Target Communications 

You need to install a serial communication program (e.g., Minicom) to access the target and obtain an IP address. 

Check the @ref getstartedDevKitCables UART2 settings are correct. If you're using Minicom, you access 
the config and initialize menus through CTRL+A Z. 

Run as <b>root</b> user, so no password is required.

You'll need to @ref getstartedConfigIP.

Once the host and target are communicating, you can complete the target setup.

@note Use the @ref toolsTarget_setNet tool to set your MAC address so you don't have to go through @c ifconfig every time 
you reboot the target.
 
@section getstartedTargetSetup_copyStartScripts Copy Startup Scripts 

Startup scripts are copied automatically to the target when @c instlegato is run the first time (see @ref getstartedTargetSetup_copyLibExe) .

You can also copy the scripts manually. Using ssh, access the target:

@code ssh root@<target ip address> @endcode
When prompted for a password, press enter.

Then create the startup directory:
@code mkdir -p  /mnt/flash/startup @endcode

Then copy the startup files to the target by running the following from the dev host:
@code
scp targetFiles/mdm-9x15/startup/fg_* root@<target ip addr>:/mnt/flash/startup
@endcode

Scripts beginning with @c fg_ are run first during startup, and then everything else is runs in the background. 
You can add more scripts to customize your target. @c fg_ scripts must have executable permissions or they will not run.

@note In the rare case you need to prevent legato starting automatically, run
@code touch /mnt/flash/startup/STOPLEGATO @endcode 

@section getstartedTargetSetup_rebootTarget Reboot Target

Wait for the target to fully reboot. The target IP address may have changed. Check it using 
@c ifconfig through the serial console before proceeding.

@section getstartedTargetSetup_copyLibExe Copy Libraries and Executables

To copy libraries and executables to the target, run:

@code 
$ instlegato build/wp7 <target ip address>  
@endcode

It will automatically start the Legato runtime components.

If target startup scripts don't exist or don't match the ones in:
@code targetFiles/mdm-9x15/startup @endcode
they'll be copied to the target.

Old startup files from the target will be copied to the host here:
@code targetFiles/mdm-9x15/backup @endcode

After the startup files are finished updating, the target will reboot. 

After the target restarts, run @c instlegato again to finish installation.

Then you can build and run apps.
