/** @page howToPowerMgmt Manage Device Power

This topic summarizes how to manage device power. Information is provided on the Legato power
management framework implementation with guidelines how to write power-efficient Legato apps.

See @ref basicPwrMgmt for general info on managing device power.

Legato uses Linux power management techniques to minimize device power consumption:

- SUSPEND: system saves its state in memory, places all peripherals in low power mode, and
puts the app processor into its deepest idle state.

- CPUIDLE:  system estimates how long the app processor would be idle and
puts it into appropriate low power state.

- CPUFREQ: system estimates how much the app processor is loaded and tunes
the CPU frequency and voltage as necessary.

While CPUIDLE and CPUFREQ seamlessly run in the O/S background, Legato apps
have significant impact on the efficiency of system SUSPEND functionality.

@section howToPowerMgmt_wakeupSources Wakeup Sources

Legato uses Linux wakeup sources (called wake locks in Android) to control the system
power state. If a component with appropriate privileges wants to prevent the system from entering
SUSPEND state, it acquires a wakeup source.

If a component with appropriate privileges has no interest in keeping the system powered,
it releases a wakeup source. Linux auto-sleep component monitors the use of all system-wide
wakeup sources and triggers entry into SUSPEND state when none of the wakeup sources are held.

Wakeup sources can roughly be classified as:

- <b>Kernel wakeup sources</b> are hard-coded in kernel components and can only be acquired
and released by kernel, module and driver code.

- <b>User-space wakeup sources</b> are created on-demand, acquired and
released by privileged app components. User apps write the wakeup source name to file
@c /sys/power/wake_lock to create and acquire wakeup source, and write the same name
to file @c /sys/power/wake_unlock to release the wakeup source.

The Legato Power Manager is the only Legato component with the privilege to write to
@c /sys/power/wake_lock and @c /sys/power/wake_unlock files. Other components that
need control over system power state must have the Linux CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND
capability assigned, and perform the following Legato calls to request service from the Power Manager:

le_pm_NewWakeupSource() create a wakeup source with a particular tag,

le_pm_StayAwake() acquire a wakeup source, and

le_pm_Relax() release a wakeup source.

When the Power Manager receives a request from another component via
le_pm_NewWakeupSource(), it'll prefix the requested tag with string @c legato_ and
post-fix it with the requestor’s process ID resulting in the wakeup source name format
@verbatim  legato_<tag>_<process-id> @endverbatim

This name format allows for easy traceability of wakeup sources. The process ID refers
to a particular Legato app and the tag refers to a particular wakeup source within that app.

A wakeup source using this name is then created on behalf of the requesting component and
a reference to the wakeup source is passed back to the requestor to use it in le_pm_StayAwake()
and le_pm_Relax() calls.

Stale wakeup sources are automatically released by the Power Manager when their
requestor exits and/or disconnects from the Power Manager.

@section howToPowerMgmt_wakeupAndDeferrable Wakeup & Deferrable Events

Legato apps run in an event-driven model so the app remains idle until there's an event to be
processed. Once an event occurs, Legato detects it and dispatches it to one of its threads for
processing.

From a power management aspect, there's no reason for the system to stay powered while it's idle.
Also, events may not have the same processing importance, so Legato classifies them like this:

- <b>Wakeup events</b>: require immediate attention so the system to must be powered.

- <b>Deferrable events</b>: can wait to be processed until the system is powered for another reason.

These event types are defined in the @c fdMonitor object. To classify the fdMonitor event as wakeup or
deferrable, the app should call le_fdMonitor_SetDeferrable() with the appropriate ‘isDeferrable’ flag.
By default, if le_fdMonitor_SetDeferrable() is not called; all events on that object will be assumed
to be wakeup events.

The underlying Linux mechanism of waiting for wakeup events from @c fdMonitor’s file descriptor
uses epoll_wait() in conjunction with @c EPOLLWAKEUP flag. When an epoll_wait() event occurs
on a file descriptor that has this flag is set, epoll_wait() will unblock the caller and an @b eventpoll
kernel wakeup source will be signaled. This causes the system to stay awake until one of these
conditions are met:

- another epoll_wait() call is made with the same file descriptor in the event list.

or

- the file descriptor is closed.

This way, callbacks for this @c fdMonitor event will be executed while @b eventpoll wakeup
source is held. This guarantees the system stays awake until all callbacks are executed.
If a Legato component needs to keep the system powered beyond the scope of a Legato callback,
it should acquire its own wakeup source.

This diagram shows a simple Legato app with process ID 25 that needs
to keep the system powered between two Legato events using wakeup source tagged
@b lock. Wakeup sources are handed off to achieve this functionality. The system remains powered
from the moment the first event occurs until the second event is fully processed.

App components that subscribe to wakeup events must have CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND Linux
capability assigned. If not, all events will be assumed deferrable and calling
le_fdMonitor_SetDeferrable() will have no effect.

@section howToPowerMgmt_clients Power Manager Clients

Using wakeup sources and EPOLLWAKEUP provides a simple programming model to write Power Manager
clients. Here are some guidelines:

- Make sure that CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND capability is assigned to the client. Client components usually
run sandboxed and unless this capability is not explicitly assigned, they will not be able to
control system power state.

- Don't acquire wakeup sources if you just need to process an event callback. In this callback,
the system will stay powered due to the @b eventpoll wakeup source.

-  Acquire a wakeup source if system processing occurs outside a Legato callback.
A typical use case is e.g. composing and sending a text message: a Legato callback won't be invoked
 until the message is submitted and hence the message composition operation may be interrupted by
 system sleep if unprotected by a wakeup source.

- Acquire a wakeup source if the system needs to stay awake monitoring a state transition. State transition
events may typically be handled in a callback, but if the system needs to stay powered across multiple
states, a wakeup source is required.

<h4>Problem </h4>

<b>System doesn't suspend. </b>

@a Probable @a cause

A wakeup source is being held <br>

@a Test

Dump contents of /sys/kernel/debug/wakeup_sources to find the fields that
have a non-zero active_since field. Also dump contents of
@c /sys/power/wake_lock to find active user-space wakeup sources. <br>

@verbatim
 cat /sys/kernel/debug/wakeup_sources |sed -e s/"^       "/"unnamed"/ | awk '{print $6 "\t" $1}' | grep -v "^0" |sort –n
 cat /sys/power/wake_lock

<h4>Problem </h4>

<b>System perpetually suspends and resumes. </b>

@a Probable @a cause

@a Test

Dump contents of @c /proc/interrupts to find the IRQ that's constantly incrementing.

@a Command

@c cat /proc/interrupts

<h4>Problem </h4>

<b>System doesn't resume. </b>

@a Probable @a cause

Wakeup interrupts aren't configured.

@a Test

Dump contents of all @verbatim /sys/devices/*/power/wakeup @endverbatim
files and check which devices have wakeup interrupts enabled.
