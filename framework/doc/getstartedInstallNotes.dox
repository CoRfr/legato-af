/** @page getstartedInstallNotes Yocto Install Notes

Here are some helpful tips for Yocto Linux working with Sierra Wireless devices.

@section yoctoNoPwd Log on Without Password
To log onto the target through the serial interface, log on as @b root with no password. 
This allows manual changes to other interfaces (e.g., USB if you want to run CDC-ECM). 

@section yoctoCDC CDC-ECM for IP vs Ethernet
Using CDC-ECM for IP connections will cause the MAC address to change every reboot because the 
kernel allocates software-defined MAC addresses to interfaces. This may cause new connections to be 
detected by your host every time you reboot the device. See @ref getstartedConfigIP and @ref toolsSetNet

@section yoctoPrefIP  Setup Preferred IP
Either boot with an Ethernet cable plugged in and let the device obtain an IP address using 
DHCP, or enable CDC-ECM and the micro-USB cable. You can then determine the IP address using 
@c ifconfig on the console or provide a fixed IP from your DHCP server. Then use @c ssh and @c scp to 
access the device and transfer files. 

@section yoctoDefUSB Change Default USB Classes
During the boot sequence, startup scripts run the file @c /etc/legato/usbsetup that 
enumerates the USB types listed in @c /etc/legato/usbmode. 

You can easily override default types by creating your own @c usbmode file in @c /mnt/flash/startup/usb. 
The new file will take precedence over the old one. By default, the device will enumerate an ECM port, 
an ACM port for AT commands and USB audio. 

@section yoctoStaticIP Setup Target Static IP

You can configure your target and development PC so it doesn't prompt for a password, run: 
@b bin/configtargetssh

 It'll look like this:
 @verbatim
dave@devbox:~/legato$ bin/configtargetssh 192.168.1.2
Generating new key pair... --->>> LEAVE THE PASSPHRASE EMPTY <<<---
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/dave/.ssh/id_rsa.legatoTarget.
Your public key has been saved in /home/dave/.ssh/id_rsa.legatoTarget.pub.
The key fingerprint is:

target devices.
The key's randomart image is:

@section yoctoReadWrite Read/Write rootfs

It's convenient right now to enable r/w to rootfs, but it will be moving to a read-only model 
soon. If you change the rootfs (e.g., in /etc, /lib, /bin), you may cripple your device and have to 
re-install your rootfs.

@section yoctoNoDown Disable New Package Download 
The Yocto build defaults to disable new package downloads. 

Enable downloading new packages over the Internet, modify: 

@c <build-dir>/conf/local.conf value @c BB_NO_NETWORK to "0" . 
The file is only present after a build has run once. 

@section yoctoBSPTestReport Setup using BSPTestReport.xls
The @c  BSPTestReport.xls spreadsheet is used for instructions and reports to help set up 
different BSP features to test. Start with the Contents sheet. 

@section yoctoNFSRoot Use nfs root 
The file @b meta-swi/meta-swi-mdm9x15/conf/machine/qcom-mdm9615.conf
contains examples if you need to include a lot of extra packages in your rootfs or if you build the debug version. 
See README.bsp for details. 
Remember to untar the generated rootfs to an exported file system. The file pointed to by the rootfs link contains the most recent root file system.
