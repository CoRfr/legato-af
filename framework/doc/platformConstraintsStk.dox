/** @page platformConstraintsStk SIM Toolkit

The AR755x, AR8652, and WP8548 platforms can use SIM Toolkit Legato functions if the CAT (Card
Application Toolkit) mode is properly set in your PRI (Product Requirement Information).

@warning <b>Known limitation with WP8548:</b>
OPEN_CHANNEL BIP command is not raised up to a user app. By consequence, it can't be
accepted/rejected.
