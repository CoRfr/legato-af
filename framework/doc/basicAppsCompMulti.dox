Now that we have @e componentized the client and server functionality, we are free to
deploy those components to any executables we want without having to change the components
at all. In fact, multiple components can be included in a single executable.

To demonstrate, we can put the two components @c greetClient and @c greetServer into the same
executable. This is a simple change to helloWorld.adef like this:

@verbatim
executables:
{
    helloServer = ( greetServer )
    helloClient = ( greetClient )
}

processes:
{
    run:
    {
        (helloClient)
        (helloServer)
    }
}

bindings:
{
     helloClient.greetClient.hello -> helloServer.greetServer.hello
}
@endverbatim


<HR>

Now we can run @c mkapp to build the application.

@code
$ mkapp helloWorld.adef -t wp85
@endcode
